Certain of the Active Sites, such as eteamz.com, require payment of access fees. By registering for those Active Sites, you hereby authorize Active to charge your credit card in advance for all applicable fees incurred by you in connection with your chosen service and registration for your account. You hereby understand and agree that in most cases, Active will be charging your designated credit card in accordance with the payment schedule of the service for which you have registered, but some service fees may accumulate on your credit card account before they are actually charged to your credit card. You further understand and agree that it is your responsibility to notify Active of any changes to your credit card or if your credit card has expired otherwise your access to the Service may be disconnected or interrupted. All fees shall be paid in U.S. dollars.\n\nActive reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, charging a fee for packages, options, upgrades and/or a Service for which Active does not currently charge a fee) or billing methods at any time, provided, however, that such modifications shall not take effect earlier than thirty (30) days after Active posts such modification on the applicable Active Site(s). Active also has the right to collect applicable taxes and impose premium surcharges for some areas of the Service and these surcharges may apply immediately after you register for the associated service. You may cancel any your Account or any associated optional or upgraded services therefore at any time, but Active will not refund any remaining portion of your pre-paid fees and you may be charged an additional cancellation fee.

That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, that Active may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. This section titled Charges and Billing For Certain Active Sites shall in no way limit any other remedies available to Active.

However, each online donation will require the organization to pay a processing and handling charge equal to 6.5% of the donated amount plus $1.00 (subject to change by Active in its sole discretion). Such charges shall be collected by Active. Fees collected from online registrants will be sent in regular intervals to the designated charitable organization in accordance with contract and law, less Active�s processing and handling fee.
