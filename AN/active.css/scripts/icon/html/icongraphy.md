Use Font AUI Icons for social icons, preferrably as a typeface. Stick to the regular or rounded styles, and avoid the circle style.

For Active products, use grayscale(ish) colors (e.g. River Bed, Rolling Stone, etc.) For marketing sites, use the brand’s official colors.

## Interaction Details

### Functional Icons

- Hover – Icon and label should act as one entity
- Form Builder – Place multiple icons in the following order: Copy, Edit, Delete

### With Label

- Both icon and label should be linkable.
- Hover – Underline label.

{% example html %}
<p>Sample icons with labels: &nbsp; <a href="#"><span class="icon-settings"></span>Settings</a> &nbsp; <a href="#"><span class="icon-pencil"></span>Edit</a> &nbsp; <a href="#"><span class="icon-copy"></span> Copy</a></p>
{% endexample %}

### Without Label

- The icon should still keep the same treatment(in blue, have hover state, clickable).
- Hover – Show a tooltip to explain the action.
